1st git repo
<br> br tag means next line 
<br>
to make changes from git there are specific commands to be used:-
<br>git config --global user.name "my name"(to name the file as you wish to the whole system with that email id)
<br>if local used then changes are made to a specific file or repo by a different particular gmail or account 
<br>git config --global user.email"someone@gmail.com"(to save changes to a paticular gmail you want to open in )
<br>git config --list(teels /shows us the changes we have made by git config )

<br>use Command git clone (http link of the repo from code section on github)to get any repo from github to our system.

<br>after making changes to that github file through local editor make sure to do the two step process:-<br>1.add<br>2.commit. 
<br>if not done changes will only appear in the file in your local system file and not on the github file.as both of them are two different files.
<br>generally there are 4 types of status
<br>1.Untracked:-new file created in the folder that git doesn't yet track.
<br>2.Modified:-changed.
<br>3.staged:-file is ready to be commited.(file which has been added but not commited.)
<br>4.Unchanged:- files after being commited.

<br>Add & Commit 
<br>add-adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area.use the syntex:- git add <-file name->
<br>for eg:- git add index.html and then check the status again.
